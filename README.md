Python utilities for interacting with [AeroAPI](https://www.flightaware.com/commercial/aeroapi/) Version 4.

## Setup

These utilities require an API key for [AeroAPI](https://www.flightaware.com/commercial/aeroapi/). Save your key in a **.env** file in the same folder as the script, containing the following line:

`API_KEY_AEROAPI_4=yourkey`

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Since these utilities call AeroAPI, they will incur API query fees.
